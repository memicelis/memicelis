### Hi there 👋

<h2> I'm Elis Memic!</h2>
<h3> Full-stack Web Developer </h3>

I'm a passionate full-stack web developer with a degree in Computer Science and a love for crafting innovative digital solutions. When I'm not immersed in code, you might find me on the handball court, where I bring the same determination and teamwork that I apply to my coding projects.

👨‍💻 As a full stack developer, I thrive on building end-to-end web applications that not only function flawlessly but also provide seamless user experiences. I believe that a solid foundation in Computer Science coupled with a creative approach can lead to truly remarkable software.

🎓 With a degree in Computer Science, I've honed my problem-solving skills and gained a deep understanding of algorithms, data structures, and software architecture. This background enables me to tackle complex challenges head-on and create robust, scalable solutions.

🛠️ My skills include:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Sass, React
- Backend: Ruby, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite
- Other languages: Java, C++, C#

🤾‍♂️ Besides coding, I'm a dedicated handball player. Just as in software development, handball requires teamwork, strategy, and adaptability. My experiences on the court have taught me valuable life lessons that I often apply in my coding journey.

🌱 Currently, I'm on a self-driven path of continuous learning. I'm excited to be advancing my skills through the Microverse program, where I'm mastering the art of independent learning. With each project I tackle, I'm pushing my boundaries and striving to create cleaner, more efficient code.

🚀 I'm always eager to connect with fellow developers, collaborate on interesting projects, and exchange insights. If you're passionate about coding, sports, or just looking to chat, feel free to reach out!
